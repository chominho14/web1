      Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha
      (along with the hare and the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the
       European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1]
       of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among
       them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been
        introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout
         the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of
         livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and
         cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part
          of daily lifeâ€”as food, clothing, a companion, and as a source of
           artistic inspiration.
